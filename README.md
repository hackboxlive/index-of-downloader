# Index of downloader

A small script to automate downloading TV shows or movies just in the format it is present on the 'index of' server.

I started watching BBT and it was really a lot of work to download each episode from ['index of Big Bang Theory'](http://dl.upload8.net/Serial/The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory/).

So, I just automated it with a small script to download the files from the base URL and store it on the local device location in the exact tree format that it is on the server.
